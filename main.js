Though spoonerisms are about letters in words in the domain of written and spoken language, numbers are included in the inputs for the random test cases and they require no special treatment.
//NOTE: All input strings will contain only two words. Spoonerisms can be more complex. For example, three-word phrases in which the first letters of the first and last words are swapped: "pack of lies" --> "lack of pies" or more than one letter from a word is swapped: "flat battery --> "bat flattery" You are NOT expected to account for these, or any other nuances involved in spoonerisms.

//Day 50: The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

// However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

// Task
// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

//Day 51: Given two Arrays in which values are the power of each soldier, return true if you survive the attack or false if you perish.

// CONDITIONS

// Each soldier attacks the opposing soldier in the same index of the array. The survivor is the number with the highest value.
// If the value is the same they both perish
// If one of the values is empty(different array lengths) the non-empty value soldier survives.
// To survive the defending side must have more survivors than the attacking side.
// In case there are the same number of survivors in both sides, the winner is the team with the highest initial attack power. If the total attack power of both sides is the same return true.
// The initial attack power is the sum of all the values in each array.

//Day 52: Positive integers that are divisible exactly by the sum of their digits are called Harshad numbers. The first few Harshad numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, ...

We are interested in Harshad numbers where the product of its digit sum s and s with the digits reversed, gives the original number n. For example consider number 1729:

its digit sum, s = 1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19
reversing s = 91
and 19 * 91 = 1729 --> the number that we started with.
Complete the function which tests if a positive integer n is Harshad number, and returns True if the product of its digit sum and its digit sum reversed equals n; otherwise return False.

function numberJoy(n) {

//Day 53: A high school has a strange principal. On the first day, he has his students perform an odd opening day ceremony:

There are number of lockers "n" and number of students "n" in the school. The principal asks the first student to go to every locker and open it. Then he has the second student go to every second locker and close it. The third goes to every third locker and, if it is closed, he opens it, and if it is open, he closes it. The fourth student does this to every fourth locker, and so on. After the process is completed with the "n"th student, how many lockers are open?

The task is to write a function which gets any number as an input and returns the number of open lockers after last sudent complets his activity. So input of the function is just one number which shows number of lockers and number of students. For example if there are 1000 lockers and 1000 students in school then input is 1000 and function returns number of open lockers after 1000th student completes his action.

The given input is always an integer greater than or equal to zero that is why there is no need for validation.

You will receive a string s as input: Each "word" represents a house, and each letter represents a citizen. All infected citizens are represented as "i" or "I" in s. You must eradicate them, and their neighbors. If an infected citizen appears after or before a space, you should not delete the space, but keep in mind that the distance from "house" to "house" (word to word) has to have only one whitespace.

The song sheets have been dropped in the snow and the lines of each verse have become all jumbled up.

Task
You have to write a comparator function which can sort the lines back into their correct order, otherwise Christmas will be cancelled!

Reminder: Below is what the final verse should look like

//Day 60: Take a list of n numbers a1, a2, a3, ..., aN to start with.

Arithmetic mean (or average) is the sum of these numbers divided by n.

Geometric mean (or average) is the product of these numbers taken to the nth root.

Example
List of numbers: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81

n = 5
Arithmetic mean = (1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81) / 5 = 121 / 5 = 24.2

Task
You will be given a list of numbers and their arithmetic mean. However, the list is missing one number. Using this information, you must figure out and return the geometric mean of the FULL LIST, including the number that's missing.

// The Coins of Ter
// Ter is a small country, located between Brelnam and the Orange juice ocean. It uses many different coins and bills for payment. However, one day, the leaders of Ter decide that there are too many small coins. Therefore, they ban the small coins. But no one knows which coins they'll ban, so they ask you to provide a tool that can recalculate a price. After all, if one does not have a 1 Terrek bill and can only give a 2 Terrek bill, one needs to adjust the oddly priced items.

// Task
// Write a function adjust, that takes a two integers: the lowest currency unit that's still allowed, and the price/debt that needs to get adjusted. All prices are going up, and debts are remitted. The lowest currency will always be positive.

// In other words:adjust takes two integers, b and n, and returns the smallest number k, such that n <= k and k % b == 0 .

// Examples
// adjust( 3, 0 ) ===  0
// adjust( 3, 1 ) ===  3
// adjust( 3, -2) ===  0

//Day 63: Scheme Reference

// Your challenge: create a function that interprets simple scheme-like math commands and returns the value resulting from the operation. We will only be working with the four main math operators (+ - * /). The main difference between these commands and actual scheme commands is that scheme commands only accept two arguments while these commands accept infinitely many arguments so as to avoid having to nest functions with like operators.

// Input: string, such as '(+ 4 3)'
// Output: number
// Constraints: 0-15 arguments, numbers from -15 to 15 (when dividing, those will never be 0)
// Edge Cases: don't forget that no arguments results in either 0 or 1 for +/- and * respectively
// Syntax consists of an open parenthesis, a math operator, a space, space-separated arguments, and a close parenthesis. Example: (+ 3 4). All inputs will be valid.

// If no arguments are provided, return the following (You won't get '(/)'):

// '(+)'         // 0
// '(-)'         // 0
// '(*)'         // 1
// Examples of valid commands:

// '(+ 3 4)'     // 7
// '(- 3 4)'     // -1
// '(* 3 4)'     // 12
// '(/ 3 4)'     // 0.75
// '(+ 4 4 -4)'  // 4

//Day 65: Write a function that flattens an Array of Array objects into a flat Array. Your function must only do one level of flattening.

You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

const invert = array => array.map(num => -num);

//Day 67: Complete the function that counts the number of unique consonants in a string (made up of printable ascii characters).

Consonants are letters used in English other than "a", "e", "i", "o", "u". We will count "y" as a consonant.

Remember, your function needs to return the number of unique consonants - disregarding duplicates. For example, if the string passed into the function reads "add", the function should return 1 rather than 2, since "d" is a duplicate.

Similarly, the function should also disregard duplicate consonants of differing cases. For example, "Dad" passed into the function should return 1 as "d" and "D" are duplicates.

Examples
"add" ==> 1
"Dad" ==> 1
"aeiou" ==> 0
"sillystring" ==> 7
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" ==> 21
"Count my unique consonants!!" ==> 7

function countConsonants(str) {

#Because 8919 * 100 = 891900 
and      8919 * 101 = 900819
E.g.# 2:

k1 = 325
k2 = 326
n = 477
#Because 477 * 325 = 155025
and      477 * 326 = 155502
Your task is to prepare a function that will receive the value of k and outputs the value of n.

The examples given above will be:

find_lowest_int(100) === 8919
find_lowest_int(325) ===  477
Features of the random tests

10 < k < 10.000.000.000.000.000 (For Python, Ruby and Haskell)
10 < k < 1.000.000.000  (For Javascript and D 1e9)

//Day 69: #Adding values of arrays in a shifted way

You have to write a method, that gets two parameter:

1. An array of arrays with int-numbers
2. The shifting value
#The method should add the values of the arrays to one new array.

The arrays in the array will all have the same size and this size will always be greater than 0.
The shifting value is always a value from 0 up to the size of the arrays.
There are always arrays in the array, so you do not need to check for null or empty.

#1. Example:

[[1,2,3,4,5,6], [7,7,7,7,7,-7]], 0

1,2,3,4,5,6
7,7,7,7,7,-7

--> [8,9,10,11,12,-1]

Day 70: Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
Your function should only return a number, not the explanation about how you get that number.

Day 71: I have four positive integers, A, B, C and D, where A < B < C < D. The input is a list of the integers A, B, C, D, AxB, BxC, CxD, DxA in some order. Your task is to return the value of D.

function alphabet(ns) {

Day 72: // TWO SUMS (EASY)

// Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

// You can return the answer in any order.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
// Output: [0,1]
// Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
// Output: [1,2]
// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
// Output: [0,1]

Solution: 

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}

//Day 73: 
Every budding hacker needs an alias! The Phantom Phreak, Acid Burn, Zero Cool and Crash Override are some notable examples from the film Hackers.

Your task is to create a function that, given a proper first and last name, will return the correct alias.

Notes:
Two objects that return a one word name in response to the first letter of the first name and one for the first letter of the surname are already given. See the examples below for further details.

If the first character of either of the names given to the function is not a letter from A - Z, you should return "Your name must start with a letter from A - Z."

Sometimes people might forget to capitalize the first letter of their name so your function should accommodate for these grammatical errors.

const initialCap = (str) => str[0].toUpperCase();
const isValidName = (name) => /^[a-z]/i.test(name);
const aliasGen = (fName, lName) => {
  return (isValidName(fName) && isValidName(lName))
    ? `${ firstName[initialCap(fName)] } ${ surname[initialCap(lName)] }`
    : 'Your name must start with a letter from A - Z.';
